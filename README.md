# Machine Learning Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a series of machine learning assignments implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. Each assignment tackles different machine learning paradigms and algorithms, providing practical insights and solutions.

## Projects

### Assignment 1: Unsupervised Learning
- **Focus**: This notebook explores various unsupervised learning techniques with an emphasis on clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- **Techniques Used**: Likely includes methods such as k-means clustering and PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

### Assignment 2: Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree
- **Focus**: This notebook delves into supervised learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees, providing foundational understanding and practical application examples.
- **Techniques Used**: The notebook probably demonstrates the application of these algorithms to regression and classification problems, including data preprocessing, model fitting, and evaluation using appropriate metrics.

### Assignment 3
- **Focus**: Assignment 3 encompasses advanced machine learning techniques with a strong emphasis on data preprocessing and ensemble methods.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - **Data Preprocessing**: In-depth handling of missing values using KNN imputation for numeric data and mode imputation for categorical data.
  - **AdaBoost**: Implementation from scratch, enhancing understanding of ensemble methods and their application in improving model performance.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Likely includes NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib (for data visualization), and possibly others depending on the specific assignments.
